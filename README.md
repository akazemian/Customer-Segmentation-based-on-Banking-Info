### Overview
In this project, I use old financial information belonging to US citizens to classify them into difefrent groups based on their demographic.


### Data
The data is available in this repo as twm_customer

### Project Outline

I will:
1. Perform customer segmentation (using clustering) to split customers into 3-5 clusters based on demographics (twm_customer table)
2. visualize the created clusters and decide the best number of clusters based on features in the data
3. visualize segmentations in 2D (using PCA to reduce the dimansions of the data)
4. Visualize in 2D how the clusters are evolving in each iteration of KMeans by creating my own KMeans algorithm.
